# fullstackjs-library

A small **Library application** built with vanilla JavaScript as part of  
**The Odin Project – JavaScript Course (Full Stack JavaScript Path)**.

This project focuses on managing application state, handling user input, and dynamically updating the DOM without using external frameworks.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project allows users to manage a personal library by adding, displaying, updating, and removing books from a collection.

It was built to practice:
- Object-based data modeling
- Event-driven programming
- DOM manipulation
- Clean project structure
- Avoiding unnecessary global variables

---

## ✨ Features

- Add new books via a form
- Display books dynamically on the page
- Toggle read / unread status
- Remove books from the library
- Responsive and clean layout
- GitHub Pages deployment

---

## 🛠 Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Listeners
- GitHub Pages

---

## 📖 How It Works

* Books are stored as JavaScript objects.
* Each book contains information such as:

  * Title
  * Author
  * Pages
  * Read status
* Event listeners handle user interactions like:

  * Adding a new book
  * Toggling read status
  * Removing a book from the list
* The DOM is re-rendered when the library data changes.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

* Structuring small JavaScript applications
* Handling forms and user input
* Updating the DOM dynamically
* Writing readable and maintainable JavaScript
* Using GitHub Actions for deployment

---

## 🔮 Possible Improvements

* Persist data using `localStorage`
* Edit existing book entries
* Filter and sort books
* Improve accessibility
* Add animations or transitions
